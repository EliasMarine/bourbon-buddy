# Profile Photo Upload Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **CSRF Token Validation**
   - Fixed the CSRF token validation in the upload API endpoint
   - Added proper error handling for missing/invalid tokens
   - Made CSRF validation configurable based on environment

2. **Type Safety Improvements**
   - Added proper type definitions for the user profile with cover photo support
   - Fixed TypeScript errors with proper type assertions
   - Improved null/undefined handling with optional chaining

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Fixed the user profile API endpoint to properly handle image updates
   - Updated the upload-image endpoint to use Supabase instead of Prisma
   - Added better error handling for all API endpoints

4. **Client-Side Token Management**
   - Added support for getting CSRF tokens from multiple sources
   - Implemented fetch request interception to automatically add tokens
   - Added fallback token generation for improved reliability

## Implementation Details

- Uses server-generated CSRF tokens with client fallbacks
- Properly integrates with Supabase for user data management
- Updates the UI immediately upon successful uploads
- Implements robust error handling and user feedback

## Security Considerations

- CSRF protection enforced in production environments
- Proper validation of file uploads (type, size, content)
- Secure storage of user data in Supabase
- Appropriate error messages that don't leak sensitive information
