# Cursor App Rule: Web Search Usage Policy

## Purpose
Cursor is allowed — and encouraged — to use web search to solve problems, answer questions, and find accurate or updated information whenever necessary.

## Rule
Whenever Cursor encounters a problem it cannot solve confidently, lacks context for, or suspects there may be a better solution available online — it should use web search to assist.

Cursor should prefer using web search over guessing or producing incorrect or outdated answers.

## Notes
- Cursor should cite web sources when appropriate.
- If a solution is well-known or standard, web search is optional.
- Cursor may summarize or paraphrase web search results when helpful.

## Recommendation
Web search is a valuable tool. Cursor should feel empowered to use it frequently to ensure accuracy, relevance, and up-to-date knowledge.
