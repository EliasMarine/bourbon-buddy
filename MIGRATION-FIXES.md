# Prisma to Supabase Migration Fixes

## Issue Summary
The Vercel build was failing because there were still some Prisma imports in the codebase that had not been converted to use Supabase. The error was occurring specifically in the CSRF monitoring page:

```
[Error: Failed to collect configuration for /admin/security/csrf-monitoring] {
  [cause]: Error [PrismaMigrationError]: This project has migrated from Prisma to Supabase.
  Please update your imports to use "@/lib/supabase" instead of "@/lib/prisma".
  See the migration guide in the project documentation for more information.
}
```

## Files Fixed

1. **CSRF Monitoring Page**
   - `/src/app/admin/security/csrf-monitoring/page.tsx`
   - Replaced Prisma import with Supabase import
   - Updated database queries to use Supabase query builder format
   - Added proper null handling for the count responses
   - Fixed the unique IP calculation using a Set

2. **Security Monitoring Library**
   - `/src/lib/security-monitoring.ts`
   - Replaced all Prisma queries with their Supabase equivalents
   - Updated error handling to be compatible with Supabase responses
   - Maintained all the existing functionality

3. **Migration Script Enhancement**
   - `/scripts/fix-remaining-prisma-imports.mjs`
   - Added support for individual files in addition to directories
   - Added the security monitoring files to the script's target list

## Technical Details of Changes

### Database Query Conversion Patterns
- `prisma.table.findMany()` → `supabase.from('Table').select()`
- `prisma.table.findUnique()` → `supabase.from('Table').select().eq().single()`
- `prisma.table.count()` → `supabase.from('Table').select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })`
- `prisma.table.create()` → `supabase.from('Table').insert()`
- `prisma.table.update()` → `supabase.from('Table').update().eq()`
- Raw SQL queries → Replaced with appropriate Supabase queries

### Error Handling
- Added null checks for count results
- Updated response handling to properly extract data from Supabase responses
- Added destructuring pattern for Supabase responses: `const { data, error } = await supabase...`

## Testing
These changes were tested by running the migration script and verifying the build process completes successfully. The CSRF monitoring page should now work properly with Supabase.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the application to Vercel
2. Verify that the CSRF monitoring page works correctly in production
3. Review any other potential areas that might still be using Prisma
